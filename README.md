# Burger-Delivery-System
Object-oriented programming (OOP) project using Java


## Burger Delivery System

The Burger Delivery System is a Java-based platform designed to streamline the process of ordering and delivering burgers to customers. It offers a seamless experience for both registered members and non-members, ensuring that burger cravings are satisfied with convenience.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

- **Encapsulation**: Utilizes classes and objects to encapsulate data and methods, ensuring data security and integrity.
- **Associations, Aggregations, Compositions**: Implements various relationships between classes to model real-world scenarios accurately.
- **Inheritance**: Leverages inheritance to create hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting code reuse and modularity.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrates polymorphic behavior through method overriding, enabling flexible and dynamic behavior.
- **Abstract Class**: Utilizes abstract classes to define common behavior and enforce consistency across subclasses.
- **Enumeration**: Implements enumeration to define a set of named constants, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Vector & ArrayList**: Utilizes Vector and ArrayList data structures for efficient collection management and manipulation.
- **File Exceptions**: Handles file-related exceptions gracefully, ensuring robust file management and error handling.

## Features:

- **Membership Options:** 
  The system accommodates both registered members and non-members, providing tailored experiences for each category of users.

- **Ordering Functionality:** 
  Users can place orders for their desired burgers, specifying details such as burger size and quantity.

- **Address Management:** 
  Customers can store and manage their delivery addresses for faster checkout.

- **Discounts and Offers:** 
  Registered members may benefit from exclusive discounts and promotional offers.

- **Flexible Payment Methods:** 
  The system supports various payment methods, including online payment for added convenience.

- **Order Tracking:** 
  Customers can track the status of their orders to stay informed about the delivery process.
